## Research Plan
- Frame a Clear Hypothesis: e.g., "A hybrid AI architecture that decouples global context generation from real-time local analysis will significantly reduce diagnostic time compared to a monolithic cloud-based approach, without a statistically significant loss in diagnostic accuracy."
-  Conduct a Rigorous Experiment: Select a specific clinical problem (e.g., lung nodule characterization). Use a public dataset (LIDC-IDRI). Implement the baselines described above.
- Collect Real Data: Run all systems (ORION and your baselines) on the entire dataset. Measure everything: end-to-end latency, computational cost (GPU hours/API calls), and diagnostic performance (AUC, F1-score, etc., comparing the AI's output to the dataset's ground truth).

    Perform a User Study: Recruit actual clinicians. This is what elevates a good paper to a great one. Prove the system is not just technically sound but clinically useful.

    Detail Your Methods: Explicitly describe the RAG synthesis mechanism, the prompt engineering for the VLM, and the embedding strategy. Be transparent about the model versions and hardware used.

    Rewrite the Paper Around Your Evidence: The current narrative is a sales pitch for an idea. The new narrative must be a scientific argument supported by the data you collected. The case study should be used as a qualitative example to illustrate a point proven by your quantitative results, not as the result itself.

In summary, you have the blueprint for an excellent system. You now need to do the science to prove it's as good as you think it is.
